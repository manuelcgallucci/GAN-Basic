# GAN-Basic
An implementation of Generative Adversarial Networks on the MNIST dataset to generate synthetic numbers.
Using Pytorch.

Example of the evolution of 16 outputs of the network trained for 100 epochs with images of the number 5.

(Note that the numbers are all very similar. This might be because the GAN suffers from "mode collapse". One possible solution might be using the Wasserstein Loss)
